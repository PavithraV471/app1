Project Title: To Do List App

Description of this project:
     This app is really useful to make "to do list" of our task. It works by authenticating with google, when signed in, our app opens and we can add our tasks to do, when it is completed we can strike through the task and also we can update our task too. 
     This app replaces pen and paper to note down the task of the day.
     Everytime we cannot have pen and paper with us, so this app makes it very easy to note down the task.
